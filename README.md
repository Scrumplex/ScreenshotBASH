ScreenshotBASH
-------------------------------
Make screenshots and upload them to your server! This script should provide an alternative to [ShareX](https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX), but for Linux. 

It relies on multiple CLIs available for most UNIX-like systems and some even for Windows. This script does not have any of the features of [ShareX](https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX) other than creating a screenshot and uploading.

# Installation

 - Install dependencies (Ubuntu: `apt install curl sox`).
 - Install compatible screenshot tool ([KDE Spectacle](https://www.kde.org/applications/graphics/spectacle/) or [GNOME Screenshot](https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-help/stable/screen-shot-record.html.en)).
 - Download a release of this repository.
 - Customize the upload.conf to match your endpoint.
 - Configure your DE to run the script with a hotkey.
